    <p>Image caption:"The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on a dramatic moment in what it later called the “Jamaica school wars,” when Samuel B. Cisco tried to enroll his children, who were Black, in the local segregated white public school. They were refused admission by white school administrators. Mr. Cisco then refused to send his children to the segregated “colored” school - and officials responded by charging him with violating New York’s law requiring school attendance for children."</p>

    <p>"Samuel B. Cisco, a Black man, lived in Jamaica, in Queens County. At the time of this newspaper article, in 1896, Queens was not yet part of New York City, and Jamaica was a small town surrounded by a rural landscape. Mr. Cisco worked as a cooper - he made barrels - and with his wife Elizabeth he had four children. Like some of their African American neighbors in Jamaica, the Ciscos wanted to challenge segregation and inequality in the education available to their children. 

Speaking to a reporter, Mr. Cisco explained: “I and my father and mother have paid taxes in Jamaica for eighty years, yet I am denied a place in the school near my house, while Irishmen, Italians and Dutchmen who have been here only three months, can go in these, although covered with dirt.” “I am a man of means in business here and yet on September 3, when my three children were sent to school where my neighbors’ children attend, they were put out and sent home crying. The colored school is three-fourth of a mile further away than the white School No. 3, and it is in the low swampy portion of the village and they are not taught as well as the children of the white schools.”

On this day in 1896, Judge Garrettson dismissed the charges against Mr. Cisco. Jamaica’s schools did not change their policy, though - and the Ciscos continued to challenge it. Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco reported that she was arrested three times for violating the school attendance law when she refused, over the next three years, to send her children to segregated Black schools."</p>
    <p>Questions:</p>
    <ul><li>How do you think Mr. Cisco’s son Jacob, who was 6 at the time, felt about his father’s protest?</li>
<li>Do the reporter and Mr. Cisco have the same view of the facilities available at the “colored” school?</li>
<li>The judge, Justice Garrertison, did not find Mr. Cisco guilty of violating the law - but he also said that separate schools in Jamaica were “merely a social condition with which the legislature had nothing to do.” Who did he think was responsible for school segregation?</li></ul>
