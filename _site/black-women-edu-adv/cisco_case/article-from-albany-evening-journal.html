    <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco worked with her husband and individually for more than five years to push schools in the town of Jamaica, and then the board of education in Queens, and then the New York State Legislature, to end school segregation and provide equal opportunity for her children. A few days after the New York State legislature passed a bill changing the state Constitution to no longer allow school segregation, Mrs. Cisco attended a gathering at a local Black church in the state capital of Albany. The newspaper wrote captured the scene with this small description. 

As you read, imagine a sanctuary full of church-goers, most of whom - because the church was part of the African Methodist Episcopal denomination - would have been African American people. They were gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the birth of John Brown, the white abolitionist who led an uprising against slavery in 1859. At this even the congregation was joined by Secretary of State John T. McDonough, who was a white man, and were led by Dr. William H. Johnson, a Black man who was one of the leaders of the church. 

As Dr. Johnson mentions the “Elsberg School Bill,” which changed the New York State Constitution to prohibit school districts from operating separate schools for Black and white students, he calls attention to Mrs. Cisco. How does he do so? Is he celebrating her? Belittling her? Both? How do those present respond? </p>
    <p>Questions:</p>
    <ul><li>What language does Dr. Johnson use to describe Mrs. Cisco? What message or messages does this language carry? </li>
<li>How would you feel in Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco’s position here? What emotions - good or bad, or contradictory - do you think she was experiencing? </li>
<li>Why do you think that, in a large church hall full of people, Mrs. Cisco is the only one whose body is discussed publicly? </li>
<li>Scholar Kimberle Crenshaw writes about “intersectionality,” or the ways that kinds of oppression and injustice can connect to one another in distinct ways - so that, for example, Black women face both racism and sexism not as separate challenges, but in connection with one another. Do you think the above situation illustrates an experience of racism, of sexism, or of their intersections in the life of Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco? </li>
<li>At this time women do not yet have the franchise - that is, they are not yet able to vote. How does that fact affect how we see this scene in the church sanctuary? </li>
<li>Think about the portrait of Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco. What do you think the scene above, and the portrait, have in common? How do they differ? Does the scene described here change how you see the portrait? </li>
