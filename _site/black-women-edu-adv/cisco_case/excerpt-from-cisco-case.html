    <p>"After a few years of pushing for desegregation of the local Jamaica schools by trying to enroll their children in segregated white institutions - and refusing to send them to segregated Black schools when they were refused - Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco brought suit against the School Board of Queens for violating the state’s education law. She and her husband participated in their previous activism together, but Mr. Cisco passed away in 1897. Mrs. Cisco carried their work forward, alongside her attorneys. 

Neither of the courts that heard the case supported Mrs. Cisco’s claims. They agreed that her children had been prohibited from attending the closest school to their home because it was a segregated white school and the Cisco children were Black, but they did not find this to be a violation of New York State law. Mrs. Cisco lost her case. 

However, by filing the case, Mrs. Cisco had drawn attention to continued legal segregation in New York State - well after New York City’s schools had ended the policy in 1883. New York’s governor Theodore Roosevelt and his allies in the state legislature acted to change the law. The legislature passed and the governor signed a bill in April 1900 that read “no person shall be refused admission into or be excluded from any public school in the state of New York on account of race or color." "</p>
    <p>Questions:</p>
    <ul><li>What does it mean that Mrs. Cisco “rests her case solely on the fact that her children were refused admission to the common school on account of their color”?</li>
<li>Is Mrs. Cisco arguing that the segregated schools for Black children are inferior, or that she opposes the rejection of her children because they are Black?</li>
<li>How do her arguments about the school’s teachers and facility compare to those made by her husband Mr. Samuel Cisco a few years earlier?</li>
<li>In 1896, the US Supreme Court declared that segregation was legal, as long as each group received equal services. This “separate but equal” standard appears (in different words) in the Cisco case. What do you think Mrs. Cisco thought of this legal ruling?</li></ul>
