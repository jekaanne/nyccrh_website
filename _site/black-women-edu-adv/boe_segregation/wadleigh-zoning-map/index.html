    <p>The map above illustrates how the New York City Board of Education zoned Wadleigh High School, an all-girls school, during the 1930s and 1940s. It shows the zone lines and data from the 1940 U.S. Census to illustrate the racial demographics of the area at this time. In 1940, the U.S. Census provided three racial categories to choose from: “White,” “Black,” and “Other.” Therefore, while this map shows clear segregation between “White” and “Black” neighborhoods in the area, it does not fully capture the diversity of the area, including people who would have identified themselves as Puerto Rican and Black or white, for example. 

In the 1930s, Harlem parents challenged the segregation of schools in the neighborhood. One form of segregation parents challenged was the Board of Education’s drawing of school zones as these  played a critical part in the assignment of students. While the Board previously allowed students to attend high schools throughout the city, this practice effectively ended after the drawing of high school zone lines. Julia Richman, another all-girls high school, used to receive significant numbers of students from Central Harlem. However, after the drawing of these zones, the Board determined that “students from certain schools in the neighborhood of Wadleigh should be denied admission to Julia Richman and should be advised to go to Wadleigh.”

When Harlem parents pointed out that the Board of Education drew school zones to segregate Wadleigh as an all-Black school, the city’s school superintendent said the school zones were not drawn with any consideration for race. To substantiate his claim, he argued that since the Board permitted some Black students to cross zone lines there was no intent to segregate. Yet, school authorities no doubt knew where Harlem was, knew where Black families lived, and that the effect of drawing school zones as such would separate students. As a result of how the Board zoned Wadleigh in 1933, enrollment at the school dramatically changed. In 1931, Wadliegh identified 25% of its students at the 114th Street campus as “colored.” By 1943, school identified 70 percent of its student body as “Negroes,” and, by 1945, that number rose to 98 percent. Not only did the imposition of these new lines restrict Black students to Wadleigh and Haaren High School, but it also barred them from attending newer high schools in the city, including Benjamin Franklin (which served only boys at the time) and George Washington as well as Julia Richman. 

In the following decades, Harlem activists, like Ella Baker, worked inside and outside the legal system to challenge the zoning practices of the Board of Education. In addition to the being a member of the Board of Education’s Intergroup Committee, Baker helped organized Parents in Action against Educational Discrimination, which was a grassroots organization powered by Black and Puerto Rican parents. Through both her work for the Board of Education and Parents in Action, Baker challenged school zoning that created perpetuated segregation and reproduced inequality. </p>

<li>Based on the placement of different high schools, how might you redraw the Wadleigh School Zone to promote integration?</li>
