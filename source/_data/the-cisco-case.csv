Cisco on Trial,Black women’s education and advocacy,The Cisco Case,cisco_on_trial.jpg,,"""The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on a dramatic moment in what it later called the “Jamaica school wars,” when Samuel B. Cisco tried to enroll his children, who were Black, in the local segregated white public school. They were refused admission by white school administrators. Mr. Cisco then refused to send his children to the segregated “colored” school - and officials responded by charging him with violating New York’s law requiring school attendance for children.""",1899,1900,"1,2,4,7,8",Newspapers.com - via Brooklyn Public Library,Newspapers.com,"""People ex. Re. Cisco v. Board of Education of Queens; New York State Constitution outlaws school segregation""","""Samuel B. Cisco, a Black man, lived in Jamaica, in Queens County. At the time of this newspaper article, in 1896, Queens was not yet part of New York City, and Jamaica was a small town surrounded by a rural landscape. Mr. Cisco worked as a cooper - he made barrels - and with his wife Elizabeth he had four children. Like some of their African American neighbors in Jamaica, the Ciscos wanted to challenge segregation and inequality in the education available to their children. 

Speaking to a reporter, Mr. Cisco explained: “I and my father and mother have paid taxes in Jamaica for eighty years, yet I am denied a place in the school near my house, while Irishmen, Italians and Dutchmen who have been here only three months, can go in these, although covered with dirt.” “I am a man of means in business here and yet on September 3, when my three children were sent to school where my neighbors’ children attend, they were put out and sent home crying. The colored school is three-fourth of a mile further away than the white School No. 3, and it is in the low swampy portion of the village and they are not taught as well as the children of the white schools.”

On this day in 1896, Judge Garrettson dismissed the charges against Mr. Cisco. Jamaica’s schools did not change their policy, though - and the Ciscos continued to challenge it. Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco reported that she was arrested three times for violating the school attendance law when she refused, over the next three years, to send her children to segregated Black schools.""","""How do you think Mr. Cisco’s son Jacob, who was 6 at the time, felt about his father’s protest?

Do the reporter and Mr. Cisco have the same view of the facilities available at the “colored” school? 

The judge, Justice Garrertison, did not find Mr. Cisco guilty of violating the law - but he also said that separate schools in Jamaica were “merely a social condition with which the legislature had nothing to do.” Who did he think was responsible for school segregation?

Excerpt from Cisco Case,Black women’s education and advocacy,The Cisco Case,cisco_excerpt.pdf,,"Samuel and Elizabeth Cisco of Jamaica, New York (today part of Queens in New York City) had been challenging school segregation for years. After Mr. Cisco passed away in 1897, Mrs. Cisco continued her struggle with a suit against the school board of Queens.","January 9, 1900","January 9, 1900","1,2,4,7,8",,Public domain,"""People ex. Re. Cisco v. Board of Education of Queens; New York State Constitution outlaws school segregation""","""After a few years of pushing for desegregation of the local Jamaica schools by trying to enroll their children in segregated white institutions - and refusing to send them to segregated Black schools when they were refused - Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco brought suit against the School Board of Queens for violating the state’s education law. She and her husband participated in their previous activism together, but Mr. Cisco passed away in 1897. Mrs. Cisco carried their work forward, alongside her attorneys. 

Neither of the courts that heard the case supported Mrs. Cisco’s claims. They agreed that her children had been prohibited from attending the closest school to their home because it was a segregated white school and the Cisco children were Black, but they did not find this to be a violation of New York State law. Mrs. Cisco lost her case. 

However, by filing the case, Mrs. Cisco had drawn attention to continued legal segregation in New York State - well after New York City’s schools had ended the policy in 1883. New York’s governor Theodore Roosevelt and his allies in the state legislature acted to change the law. The legislature passed and the governor signed a bill in April 1900 that read “no person shall be refused admission into or be excluded from any public school in the state of New York on account of race or color."" ""","""What does it mean that Mrs. Cisco “rests her case solely on the fact that her children were refused admission to the common school on account of their color”?

Is Mrs. Cisco arguing that the segregated schools for Black children are inferior, or that she opposes the rejection of her children because they are Black? 

How do her arguments about the school’s teachers and facility compare to those made by her husband Mr. Samuel Cisco a few years earlier? 

In 1896, the US Supreme Court declared that segregation was legal, as long as each group received equal services. This “separate but equal” standard appears (in different words) in the Cisco case. What do you think Mrs. Cisco thought of this legal ruling?""",,

""I am well satisfied with the result,"" he told reporters. “The passage of this act is a good thing for the colored children of the state. Experience has shown that they do not make as good progress in a separate colored school as when attending one of the common schools. In the latter they have competition with the children of other races, which arouses their ambition, quickens their perceptions and is great aid to their progress."" - from Burkholder, Ch. 1""",,,
